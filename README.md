# Spring_Boot_Learnings
This Project Will introduce you with the simple features of springboot. 
You can clone the project.
Build it using maven.
Also set up database in mysql.
Create your own database and change the connection details in the application.properties file.
and Run the application as SpringBoot App.

In this Project I have also configured Swagger UI for testing the API. It becomes so easy to test API if we use Swagger.
Once you run your springboot application go the the following URL.
URL-> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/
